# Chipseq

This section contains examples of ChIP-seq analysis scripts.

The general analysis steps are:
  + alignment of IP and input samples to the same reference genome
  + peak calling to identify statistical enrichment of IP target
  + visualization of binding positions on reference genome

For differential analysis, see RNA-seq section. Differential enrichment tools like DEseq can be applied to ChIP-seq reads.
